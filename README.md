 USB Type-C Daughter Board - TKDesign - R1

Intent is to be a general purpose USB-C Daughter board, meant to break out the circuit onto a single board, meant for use in future KB design ideas.

All work will be done in KiCad as I learn it, this is meant to be the initial revision only, future revs will get new repos as major design shifts happen.

Initial idea is for SMT with production from a board manufacturer.  Break out will be done through a planned JST style connector. Breakout will be D+/D-/VCC/GND.

More info to be added through devolpment.
